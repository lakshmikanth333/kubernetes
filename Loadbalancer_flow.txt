Flow Explanation
LoadBalancer → Node:

The external load balancer (provided by the cloud provider) forwards the request to a Node on the specific NodePort exposed by the service.

Node → ClusterIP:

The Node forwards the request internally to the ClusterIP, which is the virtual IP of the service.

ClusterIP → Pod:

The ClusterIP acts as an internal load balancer and routes the request to one of the Pods that match the service's selector.

Pod → Container:

Inside the selected Pod, the request is forwarded to the Container running your application (e.g., Nginx, Facebook app).
